# Flappy Bird
Flappy Bird recreated with JavaScript along with a source image in which all components of the game reside (visually). Animation
loops used to create an illusion of bird movement, along with the pipes, foreground, and background.


# Instructions:

- Click on the canvas to start and make the bird flap.

- Make sure the bird stays in the air and avoids the obstacles by going through the pipe. 

- The more number of obstacles dodged, the more number of points accumilated.

- Best score maintained in local storage.

Enjoy!
